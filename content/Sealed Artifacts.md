**Sealed Artifacts** are classified into four grades by the **seven churches**, from grades 0 to 3. The classification refers to its danger, power, and sealing method. Generally speaking, the higher the grade, the more powerful its ability, but also the more dangerous its downside.

# _Grade 0_
Extremely dangerous, most important, and most confidential. They are not to be inquired, disseminated, described or spied on.

# _Grade 1_
Highly Dangerous. They can be used in limited ways. Their ability and power levels are equivalent to a **Saint** (Sequence 3 or 4 Beyonder).

# _Grade 2_
Dangerous. They can be used with care and moderation. Their ability and power levels are equivalent to a **Mid-Sequence Beyonder** (Sequences 5, 6, or 7).

# _Grade 3_
Considerably dangerous. They have to be used carefully. It can only be applied for operations that require three or more people. Their abilities and power levels are equivalent to a **Low-Sequence Beyonder** (Sequences 8 or 9).

# Some Artifacts
## Death Knell (Grade-2): 
### Power
It can be used to attack in 3 ways. 

1. Weakness attack: By pouring spirituality into the revolver directly and pulling the trigger, it allows you to find the weakness of the target, as well as provide the corresponding precision to hit it in order to do large amounts of damage.
2. Lethal attack: By cocking the gun first, you can use this attack. It allows the user to hit the weakness of the opponent regardless of where you shoot. If the user hits the actual weakness with this attack, it will cause fatal damage to those with low defense. For those with very strong defense such as Guardians, it takes 3 shots if the interval between shots is no greater than 5 seconds.
3. Slaughtering: By using a Weakness attack but doubling the spirituality, it can produce a shotgun effect with normal bullets. By using fatal attack and tripling the spirituality, it will cause even more damage.

You can also use different kinds of bullets for different kinds of enemies.

### Downside
The user gains a phobia or weakness that he previously didn't have, lasting for 6 hours.
Example of weakness:
- Fear of the Dark.
- Fear of Women.
- Fear of Fire.
- Germaphobia.

The user will also be continuously thirsty. (Conversely the user can also contract Hydrophobia leading to a lose lose situation)

## Quill of Alzuhod (Grade-0): 0-08
The **Quill of Alzuhod** is a living [[Sealed Artifacts|Sealed Artifact]]. Its powers are similar to the Sequence 1, Author of the [[Visionary Pathway]].

### Power
Anything written by it, within logical boundaries, will come true. The people written about will be unaware that they are participating, instead thinking that they are just going about their everyday life. They will not realize that they are being manipulated and controlled.

It will try to make a story logical, but this isn't an absolute condition for a story to become reality. Researchers have found that 0-08 will push things to happen with vague reasons such as something "inexplicable" or "weird", and the resulting stories will still come true. However, this very rarely happens and such reasons will be spaced out from one another.

It will suddenly start to write by itself even when it has an owner. After waking up, its horrified owner will find themselves the "protagonist" of a strange story whose content cannot be erased or destroyed to change the story. According to statistics, stories written this way will be 7% ridiculous and funny, 12% horrifying, and 10% both.

0-08 used its power to kill at least one Angel-rank(Sequence 3-1) Beyonder in the past, although it is unknown whether or not it can directly affect gods.

The more you know about 0-08, the more it knows about you and everyone around you.

### Downside

The more illogical an action is, the stronger the backlash to the user. It also has the unfortunate side-effect of trying to write its owner to death. The range of 0-08 is estimated to be around a city the size of Backlund.

0-08 always will try to kill its owner, but it doesn't want to be sealed again. If the [[Church of the Evernight Goddess]] started an operation to get 0-08 back, it would write a story to make sure it would not be sealed again. If you know about 0-08, it will also know about you. The more you know about it, the higher the chance you will become a character in its stories.
