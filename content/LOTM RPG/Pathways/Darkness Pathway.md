# Sequence 9: Sleepless
- **Nocturnality**: The deeper into the night, the more powerful they become. A _**Sleepless'**_ physical strength, intuition, and mental capabilities will all increase.
    - They can see through the darkness even without any lights.
    - They only need to sleep _2-4 hours a day_.
    - They are able to sense dangers that are hidden in the dark.
- **High Spirituality**: A _**Sleepless**_ and their corresponding **Pathways** have a high **Spirituality** compared to other **Pathways**. Thus they possess high spiritual perception and sensitivity.
    - **Spirit Vision**: They can use **Spirit Vision**; however, they are unable to precisely differentiate the status of different body parts. It can only be used to see spiritual things, but is not as effective as relying on their spiritual perception.
    - **Divination Arts & Ritualistic Magic:** Their potent **Spirituality** allows them to do limited **Divination** and ritualistic magic. However, their usage of **Ritualistic Magic** is far inferior to the likes of Seers and Mystery Pryers.
