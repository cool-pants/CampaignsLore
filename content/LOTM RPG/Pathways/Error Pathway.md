# Sequence 9: Marauder
- **Night Vision**: They possess the ability to see in the darkness.
- **Superior Observation**: They gain an innate intuition of where valuable items are or even how much they're approximately worth. This applies to supernatural items as well.
    - This intuition can be so powerful, that they can sense if there is something valuable in a drawer or cupboard, without actually being capable of seeing what's inside.
- **Physical Enhancement**: After advancing, _**Marauders**_ possess a powerful body, granting them an enhanced _agility_, _dexterity_, and _strength_.
    - These enhancements grant a _**Marauder**_ powerful coordination, near inhuman level of acrobatic skills, and excellent talent in the realm of throwing various objects.
        - This allows them to commit various feats of acrobatics, such as swinging themselves up by their feet, easily scaling the outsides of buildings or using backflips to evade attacks during fights.
        - Besides that, _**Marauders**_ can also use merely one of their _arms_ to throw various heavy objects (such as swords or daggers), quickly and very precisely onto a target from a _medium_ distance.
    - They possess very _dexterous_ hands, which are even more improved than the general enhancements given to the rest of their body.
        - Their wrist and finger flexibility and dexterity is drastically heightened, making them experts at sleight of hand and grants them an edge in fields that require precise finger strength.

- **Theft (Stealing):** All the other previous abilities, whether it be **Night Vision**, **Superior Observation**, or their **Physical Enhancements**, serve to make the _**Marauder's**_ core skill of **Stealing** various _items_ and _valuables_ even more potent.
