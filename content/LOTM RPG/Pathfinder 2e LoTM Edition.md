# Why Pathfinder 2e?
Pathfinder 2e has the best way to essentially scale combat and how to determine the effectiveness of an action against a difficult opponent.

This is the **Difficulty Class** modifier of any encounter.

## Difficulty Class
This denotes the level of the opponent. For fairness sake, this can be only determined before engaging an opponent, if the party has any character skilled in Divination or high Perception ([[Visionary Pathway]] or [[White Tower Pathway]]).

> [!tip] Any non-perception based ability, like divination or scrying, has a chance of alerting the enemy.

## Playing the Game
Every action is taken through a 20 sided die. The number that you receive determines the outcome of the action. The resultant value is calculated using the below formula

```
Difficulty Class (DC) - 1d20 result = Die Roll Result
```

| Die Value | Result           |
| --------- | ---------------- |
| 1-5       | Critical Failure |
| 6-10      | Failure          |
| 11-15     | Success          |
| 16-20     | Critical Success |
### Rolling at advantage/disadvantage
This is similar to normal vanilla ttrpg style:
1. While rolling at an advantage, roll twice, take the greater roll
2. While rolling at a disadvantage, roll twice, take the lesser roll

### Actions buffed/de-buffed
Buff/De-Buff modifiers to an action will always be attached a 2d4 roll.
Some actions may include:
1. Buff of a [[Sun Pathway]] Bard for a fight against monsters or those of a corrupted pathway like [[Hanged Man Pathway]] or [[Abyss Pathway]]
2. [[Hanged Man Pathway]] Beyonder, inflicting us with "depraved" knowledge or words that drive to corruption
3. Exposure to knowledge beyond our level, like "True Names" of Angels, will attract the attention of higher beings. Leading to increasing madness at best or loss of self at worst.
4. Backlash of Divination or Perception checks

# Actions
There are 3 main types of beyonders, classes if you will:
1. Combat
	1. These can directly fight or kill opponents. Although they can also act as support or Recon, their true strength lies on the front line.
2. Support
	1. These apply buffs on other Beyonders, or Debuffs on the enemy.
	2. Their actions, may tilt the tide of war in your favour if used correctly.
3. Recon
	1. These beyonders are very tricky to catch and kill, mainly due to their powers being specifically attuned to Recon.
	2. They can provide crucial information about encounters and clues, but due to their reliance to a higher plane for such information, they also possess the greatest risk of turning mad.

> [!tip] Remember to always move your character away from public eye, when doing any highly conspicuous beyonder action. Like turning into a werewolf or using powers to change appearances.

> [!info] Beyonder Power is highly regulated by official bodies, and any public display will result in retaliation from the local enforcers.

# Combat
Combat in LoTM benefits from highly tactical and creative usage of powers.

Since the powers available are so varied and diverse in nature, players are encouraged to come up with crazy and innovative ways of how to use them.

The themes of corruption play a huge role in the universe. With too much information leading to possible corruption and madness leading to becoming a monster. Players can use this to their advantage.

Ex: _Found a corrupt artifact whispering sweet things into your ear?_ Throw it at a beyonder of the [[Hanged Man Pathway]], drive them crazy with the ramblings.

Reveal a horrifying truth to the enemy driving them to madness. (Might have little effect on Pathways which rely and boost observatory skills, intellect, etc.)

**You**: Reveal a conspiracy in which the Enemy's beloved wife and son are plotting to kill him and sacrifice him to the very god he prays to. And throw some supporting evidence (The more convincing the argument, the higher the chance it is to drive him mad. The higher the shock factor, the higher the chance to corrupt.)

**Enemy**: Whu-* Turns into a monster *

Leave a book of forbidden knowledge to a beyonder of the [[Hermit Pathway]], and watch them turn mad with the rumblings from [[The Hidden Sage]].

And so on...

# Sealed Artifacts
**Sealed Artifacts** are perhaps the most populat tool that beyonders use to fight. **Sealed Artifacts** are created using a beyonder's characteristics, thus imbuing the **Artifact** with some powers from the Beyonder's pathway.

Each **Sealed Artifact** has a potent strength and an equally potent weakness.

You can read more about them [[Sealed Artifacts|here]].

> [!tip] Work with your DM to figure out what Artifacts you want and of which Pathway/Sequence. The powers and downsides.
