**Fifth Epoch: [[Loen Kingdom|Loen Kingdom]]**
A series of murder and kidnappings all over the kingdom have taken place. All sharing the same bone-chilling hallmark: each victim's body contorted into unnatural poses, bound by chains. Deep, jagged wounds mar their Flesh, as if attacked by an animal. Most horrifying, however is the absence of crucial organs like the Heart, Lungs, Stomach or the Kidney.

With some of the victims coming from the slums of Tingen, to the Upper Echelons of Backlund, a call for help is issued to local investigators of the "Beyonder" kind.

## Setting
![[Pasted image 20241117194546.png]]
Post Industrial Revolution America. Still ruled by a monarchy, the typical societal structure. The nobles enjoy while the poor grief.

Near the outer reaches of the empire, slums are rampant, with people turning to religion for blessings and hope. A strong sense of community appears, for the only one that the poor and downtrodden have is each other.

As much as the slums are suffocated by thick Smog, terrible working conditions, plague and death. The Capital city of Backlund shows much progress, with the nobles wholly ignorant of the common people's plight.

As the rich squander all their money on their lavish fancies, the poor people suffer, as something sinister takes root.

## Powers
Little known to the common people, are a group of special beings, Known only as "Beyonders". These are **sentient beings** who have consumed **Beyonder Characteristics**, allowing them special powers.

The existence of **Beyonders** is not known to most people. The authorities, such as the churches, the police, and the royal family, will actively try to prevent ordinary civilians from getting involved with matters related to **Beyonders**. However, if somebody were to find out and become inadvertently involved, they will have the opportunity to serve the local church as civilian staff. Alternatively, they can also choose to serve with the church as an official **Beyonder** by taking a potion.

Compared to normal civilians, **Beyonders** have enhanced durability and constitution, allowing them to resist things that would kill normal people. Moreover, they also gain some resistance to mental influences.
