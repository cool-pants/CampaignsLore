**Beyonders** are sentient beings who have consumed **Beyonder Characteristics**, allowing them to advance to higher Sequences in a Pathway. The most common method of advancement are through consuming potions made of Beyonder Characteristics and other supplementary materials.

There are multiple [[Pathways To The Divine|Pathways]] for **Beyonders** to take, all starting from Sequence 9 and make their Way up to Sequence 1. **Beyonders** gain power from these specific potions but have to endure the side-effects (paranoia, hallucinations, etc.) that ensue upon consuming them. There is a chance they will succumb to the side-effects and lose control - becoming monsters themselves.

<p>In ancient times, many **Beyonder** creatures believed that gathering similar power would lead to qualitative change and breakthrough. However, all of them turned mad or lost control without exception. Only after the <a href="First Blasphemy Slate.md" class="internal-link">First Blasphemy Slate</a> was discovered that they realized the need for a balance and the existence of pathways as a guide.</p></details>

The existence of **Beyonders** is not known to most people. The authorities, such as the churches, the police, and the royal family, will actively try to prevent ordinary civilians from getting involved with matters related to **Beyonders**. 

However, if somebody were to find out and become inadvertently involved, they will have the opportunity to serve the local church as civilian staff. Alternatively, they can also choose to serve with the church as an official **Beyonder** by taking a potion.
