A **Pathway** , or **Path of the Divine**, corresponds to a series of 10 named potion formulas that give access to supernatural and mystical powers. Once a being has drunk a potion, they become a Beyonder of that pathway.

Each pathway belongs to a group containing one or more neighboring pathways, which a Beyonder can safely switch within at High-Sequence.

Each Sequence contains its own abilities, and each pathway has its own authorities. The abilities within a Pathway expand in scope and variety as one advance in Sequence. Different pathways can do very different things, ranging from utility abilities such as divination or equipment crafting to a powerful offense such as weather or spirit control.
