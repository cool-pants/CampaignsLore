# Sequence 9: Savant
- **Knowledge (Mysticism and Mechanics): _Savants_** believe that knowledge is power and through drinking the potion, they gain new information about mysticism and mechanics.
    - They have a rough understanding of the mysticism, but are more knowledgeable about the formation and use of _aqua regia_, nitroglycerin, and other complicated bolts and gears.
        - To an average person, they appear to know everything.
- **Recall (Memory)**: This is the core ability of a _**Savant**_. With it, they can recall every single piece of _knowledge_ and _experience_ they have ever seen.
    - At the same time they also possess increased learning and comprehension skills.
