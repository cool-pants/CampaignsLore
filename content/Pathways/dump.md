- **Enhanced Memory**: Initially, those who drink the _**Seer**_ potion will gain a slight increase in memory that will continuously improve during potion digestion.
    - This **Enhanced Memory** grants a _**Seer**_ the ability to memorize and learn the steps of various [Ritualistic Magic](https://lordofthemysteries.fandom.com/wiki/Ritualistic_Magic "Ritualistic Magic") and [Divination Arts](https://lordofthemysteries.fandom.com/wiki/Divination_Art "Divination Art").

        - They can “see” obstructed objects and “hear” faint footsteps, allowing them to take preemptive judgment. However, their visual, auditory, and tactile senses do not have any enhancements. **Perception Roll**
    - **Divination Arts & Ritualistic Magic**: They can master all kinds of [Divination](https://lordofthemysteries.fandom.com/wiki/Divination_Art "Divination Art") methods, including astrology, spiritual numbers, and scrying as well as become more learned than a _**[Mystery Pryer](https://lordofthemysteries.fandom.com/wiki/Hermit_Pathway/Abilities#Sequence_9:_Mystery_Pryer)**_ when it comes to [Ritualistic Magic](https://lordofthemysteries.fandom.com/wiki/Ritualistic_Magic "Ritualistic Magic").
        - _**Seers**_ don't gain knowledge on how to directly utilize these mystical arts, only the ability and talent to do them at an expert level. Their mastery is dependent on their time learning.
    - **Danger Intuition**: They can intuitively detect danger using their **Spirituality**. 

### Sequence 9: Marauder
- **Night Vision**: They possess the ability to see in the darkness.
- **Superior Observation**: They gain an innate intuition of where valuable items are or even how much they're approximately worth. This applies to supernatural items as well.
    - This intuition can be so powerful, that they can sense if there is something valuable in a drawer or cupboard, without actually being capable of seeing what's inside.
- **Physical Enhancement**: After advancing, _**Marauders**_ possess a powerful body, granting them an enhanced _agility_, _dexterity_, and _strength_.
    - These enhancements grant a _**Marauder**_ powerful coordination, near inhuman level of acrobatic skills, and excellent talent in the realm of throwing various objects.

        - Besides that, _**Marauders**_ can also use merely one of their _arms_ to throw various heavy objects (such as swords or daggers), quickly and very precisely onto a target from a _medium_ distance.
    - They possess very _dexterous_ hands, which are even more improved than the general enhancements given to the rest of their body.
        - Their wrist and finger flexibility and dexterity is drastically heightened, making them experts at sleight of hand and grants them an edge in fields that require precise finger strength.

- **Theft (Stealing):** All the other previous abilities, whether it be **Night Vision**, **Superior Observation**, or their **Physical Enhancements**, serve to make the _**Marauder's**_ core skill of **Stealing** various _items_ and _valuables_ even more potent.

### Sequence 9: Apprentice
**New Abilities**
- **Door Opening**: They can open some things related to **Doors**. This has a variety of applications.

        - They cannot bring other people with them while using this Beyonder power.
- **Spirit Vision**: They can use [Spirit Vision](https://lordofthemysteries.fandom.com/wiki/Spirit_Vision "Spirit Vision") to see non-physical things, such as ghosts and specters.

### Sequence 9: Spectator
- **Body Language Analysis**: _**Spectators**_ possess keen powers of observation when it comes to observing individuals in either an _individual_ or _group_ sense.
    - They can look at a person strictly from a bystander's perspective, discovering their true thoughts from their expressions, their manners, and their subconscious actions.
        - Through this, they can accurately figure out connections and draw conclusions from the details they gathered to form an accurate mental model of the target.
- **Enhanced Mental Attributes**: A _**Spectator's**_ [Body of Heart and Mind](https://lordofthemysteries.fandom.com/wiki/Soul#Body_of_Heart_and_Mind "Soul") would receive great _enhancement_, mostly on their _inferential, analytical, observational,_ and _identification abilities_ along with their _memory_.
    - If an animal drinks this potion, it will gain intelligence and the ability to speak in human language.
- **Enhanced Vision**: Upon drinking this potion, a _**Spectator**_ will also possess the sharpened eyesight needed to analyze a target's body language.
    - Even though [Audrey Hall](https://lordofthemysteries.fandom.com/wiki/Audrey_Hall "Audrey Hall") was in the corner of a ballroom party, she could still accurately notice the subtle movements of other people from afar.

### Sequence 9: Sailor (Keeper of the seas)
- **Phantom Scales (Scale Armor)**: _**Sailors**_ will gain illusory scales under their skin that make them slippery and hard to grab and can be used to cover the surface of their skin in order to form armor that reduces damage taken from attacks.
    - These **Phantom Scales** grow stronger as they progress through the **Sequences**.
        - At **Sequence 9** their **Phantom Scales** can block the shot of a _double-barrel shotgun_.

### Sequence 9: Bard
**Enhancement:** They can imbue courage, strength, and agility for themselves and their allies through their singing, a "job" that brought about devotion and submission.

### Sequence 9: Secrets Suppliant
- **Mystical Knowledge**. _**Secrets Suppliants**_ are bestowed with a decent amount of knowledge regarding sacrifices and some knowledge on [Ritualistic Magic](https://lordofthemysteries.fandom.com/wiki/Ritualistic_Magic "Ritualistic Magic").
    - There are some [honorific names](https://lordofthemysteries.fandom.com/wiki/Honorific_Name "Honorific Name") included in the potion's knowledge, but they're all secret entities with sinister names that includes elements like "depravity", "true kin", or the "gaze of fate".
- **High Spirituality**: _**Secrets Suppliants**_ have a high spiritual sense which they can use it to detect some mysterious and horrible existences.
    - **Ritualistic Magic and Divination Arts**: They can use their strong **Spirituality** to perform [Divination](https://lordofthemysteries.fandom.com/wiki/Divination_Art "Divination Art") and **Ritualistic Magic**, but it's not as accurate as pathways that specialize in this field.
    - Their **High Spirituality** also allows them to detect auras of relatively powerful **Beyonders** (provided that those **Beyonders** did not conceal their aura beforehand).
