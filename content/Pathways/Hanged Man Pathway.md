# Sequence 9: Secrets Suppliant
- **Mystical Knowledge**. _**Secrets Suppliants**_ are bestowed with a decent amount of knowledge regarding sacrifices and some knowledge on **Ritualistic Magic**.
    - There are some honorific names included in the potion's knowledge, but they're all secret entities with sinister names that includes elements like "depravity", "true kin", or the "gaze of fate".
- **High Spirituality**: _**Secrets Suppliants**_ have a high spiritual sense which they can use it to detect some mysterious and horrible existences.
    - **Ritualistic Magic and Divination Arts**: They can use their strong **Spirituality** to perform **Divination** and **Ritualistic Magic**, but it's not as accurate as pathways that specialize in this field.
    - Their **High Spirituality** also allows them to detect auras of relatively powerful **Beyonders** (provided that those **Beyonders** did not conceal their aura beforehand).
