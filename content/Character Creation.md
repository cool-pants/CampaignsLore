On to the Fun part now.

For character creation, you need to decide a couple of things first:
1. Name
2. Gender
3. Age (Very Important)
4. Background
5. Pathway
6. Faction (Optional)
7. Inventory

# Name
This is very important when playing a campaign, much less a oneshot. Since as you gain more fame and grow in sequence, your name either inspires terror or awe in other beyonders.

# Gender
Not really that important tbh.

# Age
With age comes wisdom, and also deterioration of the mind. An older person is more susceptible to the corruption of the Pathways. So keep that in mind, while creating a character.

# Background
This plays an important role in long running campaigns. Since this will determine social circles, cults and connections from where you can acquire ingredients for advancement potions, or even just the recipe.
A noble will be more familiar with the Beyonder world and may have more opportunities to get ingredients/potions to advance.
A cult or church member may be able to find subsequent potion recipes which are associated with the Church.
Ex: It is known that the [[Church Of The Evernight Goddess]] has the initial recipes for [[Darkness Pathway]] and the [[Death Pathway]].

# Pathway
This decides your power, alignment, play style and how your character will act to a certain extent. Every Beyonder starts with a Sequence 9 potion of the selected pathway.

At the beginning of each Campaign, each player will need to select a pathway and they will start from Sequence 9 of that pathway.

## Pathway Mechanics
This is a good time to introduce **Potion Digestion** and **Acting**.

Once a potion is consumed, players do not get full access to the powers of the potion. They need to **Digest** the potion to get access and more control over the powers and the inherent madness of the ingredients.

**How to digest a potion then?**
Players need to digest their potion by **Acting** as the potion/sequence directs. The Acting directives are hidden in the name of the Sequence.

> [!tip] A Beyonder of the [[Fool Pathway]] Sequence 9: Seer, will probably act as seers or divination experts. Giving Horoscopes, Astrology Divinations and Tarot Divinations to digest their Potion. The more their identity as a Seer is cemented, the more the potion is digested.

**Progression** follows the **Milestone** approach instead of straight up experience based progression. The more you progress in **Digesting** your potion, the more potent your powers become.

# Faction (Not Recommended for Oneshots)
Not a very crucial part of character creation, but surely ensures more interaction options with certain NPCs.
Ex:
- For a Player associated with the [[Church Of The Evernight Goddess]], they can employ the assistance of the [[Nighthawks]]
- For a Player associated with the [[Church of the God of Steam and Machinery]] they can employ the assistance of the [[Machinery Hivemind]]

## Available Factions:
- The 8 Orthodox Churches
	- [[Church Of The Evernight Goddess]]
	- [[Church Of The God Of Combat]]
	- [[Church Of The Earth Mother]]
	- [[Church Of The Lord Of Storms]]
	- [[Church of the God of Steam and Machinery]]
	- [[Church Of The God Of Knowledge and Wisdom]]
	- [[Church Of The Eternal Blazing Sun]]
	- [[Church of the Fool]]

# Inventory
- Every Player starts with 15 Pounds (3x5 Pound notes)
- Any medieval weapon is fair game
- Ranged Weapons
	- Blowdart
	- Revolver (Silver Bullets)
	- Musket
- **[[Sealed Artifacts]]**: Work with DM to specify which Sealed Artifacts you want, or if you want to create a new one. (Not Recommended. Since if needed, the DM will include such artifacts to be acquired during the session.)

> [!tip] Character Clothing should be in the fashion of people from the Enola Holmes TV series. Basically post Industrial Revolution American Attire.
